## 🎯 Goal of This Repository

To track my complete journey from a beginner to a professional software developer  
— learning Python, DSA, AI, ML, projects, system design, and more, step by step.

Every commit shows progress.  
Every file represents something I learned.

## 🧪 Tests & CI (Coming Soon)

I will add:
- A `tests/` folder  
- Automated tests for each script  
- GitHub Actions CI to automatically test everything I push  

This will make the repository fully professional.
